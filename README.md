## Purpose

- Designed to manage sessions and session-related logic.
- Acted as a backend component in the ConvyrClaimer system.
- Sessions were stored as files.

## Issues

Storing all session data in files turned out to be a major architectural mistake. This approach led to scalability and performance issues and has since been abandoned in favor of better solutions.
